      <h2>Mathematical Optimization</h2>
      <h4>Introduction:</h4>

      <p>
        Mathematical optimization (alternatively spelled optimisation) or
        mathematical programming is the selection of a best element, with regard
        to some criterion, from some set of available alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Optimization problems can be divided into two categories, depending on
        whether the variables are continuous or discrete:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          An optimization problem with discrete variables is known as a discrete
          optimization, in which an object such as an integer, permutation or
          graph must be found from a countable set.
        </li>
        <li>
          A problem with continuous variables is known as a continuous
          optimization, in which optimal arguments from a continuous set must be
          found. They can include constrained problems and multimodal problems.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Such a formulation is called an optimization problem or a mathematical
        programming problem (a term not directly related to computer
        programming, but still in use for example in linear programming â€“ see
        History below). Many real-world and theoretical problems may be modeled
        in this general framework.
