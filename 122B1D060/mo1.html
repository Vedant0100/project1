      <h4>Simplex Method</h4>
      <p>
        The simplex algorithm is the original and still one of the most widely
        used methods for solving linear maximization problems. However, to apply
        it, the origin (all variables equal to 0) must be a feasible point. This
        condition is satisfied only when all the constraints (except
        non-negativity) are less-than constraints and with positive constant on
        the right-hand side. The Big M method introduces surplus and artificial
        variables to convert all inequalities into that form. The "Big M" refers
        to a large number associated with the artificial variables, represented
        by the letter M.
      </p>
      <h4>Steps :</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Multiply the inequality constraints to ensure that the right hand side
          is positive.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the problem is of minimization, transform to maximization by
          multiplying the objective by −1.
        </li>
        <li>
          For any greater-than constraints, introduce surplus si and artificial
          variables ai (as shown below).
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose a large positive Value M and introduce a term in the objective
          of the form −M multiplying the artificial variables.
        </li>
        <li>
          For less-than or equal constraints, introduce slack variables si so
          that all constraints are equalities.
        </li>
        <li>Solve the problem using the usual simplex method.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Big M Method</h4>
      <p>
        If an LP has any ≥ or = constraints, a starting BFS may not be readily
        apparent. When a BFS is not readily apparent, the Big M method or the
        two phase simplex method may be used to solve the problem
      </p>
      <p>
        The Big M method is a version of the Simplex Algorithm that first finds
        a BFS by adding "artificial" variables to the problem. The objective
        function of the original LP must, of course, be modified to ensure that
        the artificial variables are all equal to 0 at the conclusion of the
        simplex algorithm.
      </p>
      <h4>Steps :</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Modify the constraints so that the RHS of each constraint is
          nonnegative (This requires that each constraint with a negative RHS be
          multiplied by -1. Remember that if you multiply an inequality by any
          negative number, the direction of the inequality is reversed!). After
          modification, identify each constraint as ≥ , ≤ or = constraint.
        </li>
        <li>
          Convert each inequality constraint to standard form .If constraint i
          is ≤ constraint, we add a slack variable si; and if constraint i is ≥
          constraint, we subtract an excess (surplus) variable ei
        </li>
        <li>
          Add an artificial variable ai to the constraints identified as ≥ or =
          constraints at the end of Step 1. Also add the sign restriction ai ≥ 0
        </li>
        <li>
          Let M denote a very large positive number. If the LP is a min problem,
          add (for each artificial variable) Mai to the objective function
          (before equal to 0). If the LP is a max problem, add (for each
          artificial variable) -Mai to the objective function(before equal to
          0).
        </li>
        <li>
          Since each artificial variable will be in the starting basis, all
          artificial variables must be eliminated from objective row before
          beginning the simplex. Now solve the transformed problem by the
          simplex (In choosing the entering variable, remember that M is a very
          large positive number!).
        </li>
      </ol>
